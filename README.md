# Flower Garden Project ðŸŒ¸

This Python Turtle project generates a random flower garden based on user input, allowing you to select the flower type, background color, and the number of flowers.

## How It Works

1. **Flower Drawing Functions**: The project includes functions to draw the following flowers:
   - Sunflower
   - Rose
   - Daisy
   - Tulip
   - Lily
2. **Random Positioning**: The flowers are randomly placed across the screen to create a garden effect.
3. **User Input**: The user describes the garden they want in natural language, specifying:
   - Flower type
   - Number of flowers
   - Background color
   
   Example input: `"3 sunflowers on a blue background"`
   Somewhere in the input there should be a number, flower type and color
5. **Main Loop**: The code analyzes the input, sets up the turtle, and draws the requested number of flowers.

## Features

- Draws multiple types of flowers.
- Randomly positions flowers on the screen.
- Customizable number of flowers and background color.

## Limitations
- Since the flower positioning is randomized, sometimes it may overlap especially if you are asking to draw a large amount
- You can input whatever you want, however the program only recognizes 5 specific types of flowers and 5 specific background colors
- The program searches the input for keywords so the input must have a number, a flower type and a background color preferably in a format like "4 roses on a black background"
