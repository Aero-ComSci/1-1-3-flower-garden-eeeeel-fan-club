# Flower Garden Project ðŸŒ¸

This Python Turtle project generates a random flower garden based on user input, allowing you to select the flower type, background color, and the number of flowers.

## How It Works

1. **Turtle Setup**: Initializes the turtle with a customizable background color and prepares it for drawing.
2. **Flower Drawing Functions**: The project includes functions to draw the following flowers:
   - Sunflower
   - Rose
   - Daisy
   - Tulip
   - Lily
3. **Random Positioning**: The flowers are randomly placed across the screen to create a garden effect.
4. **User Input**: The user describes the garden they want in natural language, specifying:
   - Flower type
   - Number of flowers
   - Background color
   
   Example input: `"3 sunflowers on a blue background"`
   
5. **Main Loop**: The code parses the input, sets up the turtle, and draws the requested number of flowers.

## Usage

1. Run the code in a Python environment with `turtle` support.
2. Enter a description of the garden when prompted (e.g., `"2 tulips on a green background"`).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)

## Features

- Draws multiple types of flowers.
- Randomly positions flowers on the screen.
- Customizable number of flowers and background color.
